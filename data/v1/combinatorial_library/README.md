# KinFragLib: Combinatorial library 

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.3956580.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3956580)

This folder is meant for the metadata and properties of the KinFragLib combinatorial library, which is based on the KinFragLib fragment library at https://github.com/volkamerlab/KinFragLib. This dataset is used for the analysis of the combinatorial library.

**Note**: Since this dataset contains large files, we provide it outside this repository at https://zenodo.org/record/3956580 (DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.3956580, v1.0.1).
In order to run the analysis notebooks, please download this dataset to this folder. 

## Raw data

- `combinatorial_library.json`: Full combinatorial library, please refer to `notebooks/4_1_combinatorial_library_data_preparation.ipynb` at https://github.com/volkamerlab/KinFragLib for detailed information about this data format
- `combinatorial_library_deduplicated.json`: Deduplicated combinatorial library (based on InChIs)
- `chembl_standardized_inchi.csv`: Standardized ChEMBL 25 molecules in the form of InChI strings.

## Processed data

Data extracted from `combinatorial_library_deduplicated.json`, performed in `notebooks/4_1_combinatorial_library_data_preparation.ipynb` at https://github.com/volkamerlab/KinFragLib.

- `n_atoms.csv`: Number of atoms for each recombined ligand
- `ro5.csv`: Number of ligands that fulfill Lipinski's rule of five (Ro5) and its individual criteria; number of ligands in total
- `subpockets.csv`: Number of ligands per subpocket combination
- `original_exact.json`: Ligands with exact matches in original ligands, i.e. KLIFS ligands that were used for the fragmentation
- `original_substructure.json`: Ligands with substructure matches in original ligands, i.e. KLIFS ligands that were used for the fragmentation
- `chembl_exact.json`: Ligands with exact matches in ChEMBL
- `chembl_most_similar.json`: Most similar ligand in ChEMBL for each recombined ligand 
- `chembl_highly_similar.json`: Most similar ligand in ChEMBL for each recombined ligand with similarity greater than 0.9.
