## Description

**Exploring the kinase inhibitor space using subpocket-focused fragmentation and recombination**

Protein kinases play a crucial role in many cell signaling processes, 
making them one of the most important families of drug targets.
Fragment-based drug design has proven useful as one approach to developing novel kinase inhibitors. 
Usually, fragment-based methods follow a knowledge-driven approach, i.e., optimizing a focused set of fragments into 
molecular hits. 

We present here *KinFragLib*, a data-driven kinase-focused fragment library based on the structural kinome data 
retrieved from the [KLIFS](https://klifs.vu-compmedchem.nl) database.
Each kinase binding pocket (for DFG-in structures with non-covalent ligands) is automatically divided in *KinFragLib* 
into six subpockets, i.e. the adenine pocket (AP), front pocket (FP), solvent-exposed pocket (SE), gate area (GA) as 
well as back pocket 1 and 2 (B1 and B2), based on defined pocket-spanning residues.
Each co-crystallized ligand is fragmented using the BRICS algorithm and its fragments are assigned to the respective 
subpocket they occupy. 
Following this approach, a fragment library is created with respective subpocket pools. This fragment library enables 
an in-depth analysis of the chemical space of known kinase inhibitors and can be used to enumerate recombined 
fragments in order to generate novel potential inhibitors.

We have added an extension with *CustomKinFragLib* which provides a pipeline to filter the fragments in KinFragLib checking for unwanted substructures (PAINS and Brenk et al.), lead-/drug-likeness (Rule of Three and QED), synthesizability (similarity to buyable building blocks and SYBA) and pairwise retrosynthesizability. Each filter can be (de-)activated and the parameters can be modified by the user to create a customized filtered fragment library. 

## Quick start

1. Clone this repository.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/volkamerlab/KinFragLib.git
    ```

2. Create the `kinfraglib` conda environment. 

    ```bash
    # Change to KinFragLib directory
    cd /path/to/KinFragLib   
 
    # Create environment
    # Hint: if conda is too slow, consider mamba instead
    conda env create -f environment.yml
    # When using a MacBook with an M1 chip you may need instead:
    CONDA_SUBDIR=osx-64 conda env create -f environment.yml

    # Activate environment
    conda activate kinfraglib

    # Install the kinfraglib pip package
    cd ..
    pip install -e KinFragLib
    ```

3. Open the notebook `quick_start.ipynb` for an introduction on how to load and use the fragment library.

    ```bash
    # Change to KinFragLib directory (if you have not already)
    cd /path/to/KinFragLib
 
    # Start jupyter lab to explore the notebooks
    jupyter lab
    ```
